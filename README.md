## Survival Prediction & Exploratory Analysis -- webApp

This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning workflow using the iconic Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which is a classic binary classification task aimed at predicting passenger survival. The goal is to build a robust, interpretable, and deployable model capable of estimating the likelihood of survival based on a variety of passenger features. It is complete end-to-end machine learning project that includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment usingÂ Streamlit.


## Features

## Project Workflow

The project follows a complete data science pipeline that includes:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant features, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

- **Feature Engineering for Model Optimization**  
  Transforming categorical variables, creating new features like FamilySize, and encoding data for model compatibility.

- **Model Comparison using Cross-Validation and Accuracy Metrics**  
  Evaluating models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM using `cross_val_score` and classification metrics.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning for Performance Enhancement**  
  Optimizing model parameters using techniques like Grid Search for improved accuracy.

- **Deployment of the Final Model using Streamlit**  
  Building a streamlit web app to make predictions interactively based on user input and perform end-to-end exploratory data analysis.
