# Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ ML Web App

A complete end-to-end machine learning project using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment using Streamlit.

---

## Features

- Full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (`FamilySize`, `IsAlone`)
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling
- Model Comparison: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- Visualizations: Age distribution, survival by class/gender, etc.
- Deployment via **Streamlit**

<!--## Sample Screenshot

(Add a screenshot of your Streamlit app here if you want)

--->

## How It Works

1. User enters passenger details
2. Model predicts survival (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)
3. Output is shown live via Streamlit UI
